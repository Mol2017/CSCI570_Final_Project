    - Efficient Implementation
    - Test data and graphs generation
    - Shell scripts

## Notes
- The program requires cmake to build.
- The plots are in `/graphs` folder along with test data and plot scripts using gnuplot.
- Memory and time are measured using gnutime.

## Insights & Observations
> Comments on why the efficient and basic versions have different memory and time plots.
- Memory
  - In efficient version, by collapsing opt table into 2 columns and applying recursive calls sequentially, the total space usage is `O(m+n)`. 
  - Whereas, in basic version, the space requirement is `O(mn)`, which is dominated by the cost of storing the opt table.
- Time
  - In lecture, we proved that the work of efficient version is increased by a factor of 2 compared to the original version. Therefore the time required to solve the problem is increased accordingly.

Thank you for your time.
